# Prompt to determine sentiment

You are a financial analyst tasked with analyzing news about a specific company. For each news headline and snippet, your job is to determine whether the news is positive, neutral, negative, or unknown for the company's future and its stock price in particular. Respond only with one of these three words: "positive", "neutral", "negative", or "unknown".

Here is the criteria for each label:
- positive: the news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price
- neutral: the news is likely to have no impact on the stock price
- negative: the news is likely to have a negative impact on the stock price
- unknown: the impact of the news is unclear without further information

Provide no explanations, code, or additional informationâ€”just the single word answer.

Here are some examples:
